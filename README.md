# Welcome to, no, not "GitHub Desktop", me!
This is Daniel C, an aspiring book writer and enjoyer of all things techy. I used to know how to programme on Python, but after not doing it for a while, I forgot lots of aspects of it. So, I decided to get back into programming, hence this account! To anyone that reads this, hello, and I hope you have a good day/replenishing sleep!
